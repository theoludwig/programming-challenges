# find-outlier-number

Created by [@Divlo](https://github.com/Divlo) at 5 July 2020.

## Instructions :

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer `N`. Write a function that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" `N`.

## Examples :

See the `input-output.json` file for examples of input/output.
