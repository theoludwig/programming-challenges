# first-non-repeating-character

Created by [@theoludwig](https://github.com/theoludwig) on 15 November 2020.

## Instructions

Write a function that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

For example, if given the input `'stress'`, the function should return `'t'`, since the letter `'t'` only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.

If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string (`""`).
