## Instructions

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Constraints

- $$1 <= numbers.length <= 3 \times 10^4$$
- $$-3 \times 10^4 <= numbers[index] <= 3 \times 10^4$$
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
