Created by [@Divlo](https://github.com/Divlo) on 5 July 2020.

## Instructions :

The function should return `true` if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome and `false` if it's not the case.

**Note :** a **Palindrome** is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the **same backwards as forwards**, e.g. Kayak.

## Examples :

See the `input-output.json` file for examples of input/output.
