## Instructions

This summer, you plan to organize a large party and invite many
friends. They have a sweet tooth, so you plan to bake nice cakes for them.
You know the recipe for a nice chocolate cake, and you want to cook as
many of them as possible.

Given the `N` ingredients needed to make a single cake and the
ingredients that you have in your kitchen, how many cakes can you
make?

### Input

- **Line 1:** Single integer `N` for the number of ingredients.
- **`N` next lines:** One for each ingredient. Each of these lines contains two positive integers:
the first one is the required quantity of this ingredient per cake, the second one is the quantity of
this ingredient you have in your kitchen.

### Output

The output should contain a single integer: the maximum number of cakes you can make using the
available ingredients.

### Constraints

- $$1 <= N <= 10$$
- All ingredient quantities will be integers between 1 and 10 000.
