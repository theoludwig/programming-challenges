- A triangle is `isosceles` when 2 of its sides are equal
- A triangle is `scalene` when none of its sides is equal to another side
- A triangle is `impossible` when the sum of two of its sides is strictly less than the third side

## Input

- **Line 1 to 3:** The length of each side of the triangle
