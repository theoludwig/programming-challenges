## Instructions

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.

The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

You can't use the same numbers twice in a:

- row
- column
- square of 3x3

Write a program that solves the Sudoku given in input.

The empty cells are represented by 0.
